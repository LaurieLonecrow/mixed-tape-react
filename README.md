# MIXED TAPE


The app pulls data from Spotify and shows a user's playlists, allowing customizations such as adding descriptions and saving the playlists in order to share them with other users.

## Installation

- This app can be forked and run locally by implementing the .env.example file as the root .env file, with the correct port numbers for your client and server ports. You will also need a Spotify Developer account setup so that you can create your own Spotify Client Id and Secret. And finally, you will need to implement a MongoDB connection.

## How it works

This app is built using React with Styled Components, and served in Express/Node.js with a database on MongoDB Atlas controlled with Mongoose.
